                <p>
                    TotalityHacks is a collegiate hackathon without the limitations of a university. The advantages of this are countless,
                    but as an attendee the biggest difference is focus. The participants will be experienced hackers from around the country. Instead of needing to try and cater to beginners from a host school, we're choosing to cater Totality only to the most committed and experienced hackers. Furthermore, our organizing team is composed of experts from around the nation who have participated in and organized multiple hackathons, and they will be working to make your
                    time at Totality one to remember.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Totality will feature innovation across the board with the hacker experience. Workshops and tech
                    talks will cater to advanced topics&mdash;no more struggling to find something more interesting than "Intro to Python."
                    We'll be announcing exact workshop titles at a later date. We're also working to optimize the hiccups commonly
                    seen in hackathons. Food distribution won't be in one place reducing lines. Check in will be fully automated
                    through technology. Activities will be scattered to reduce lines. We're even going to innovate in category
                    prizes: think category prizes along the lines of best hack without electricity in addition to the usual best
                    hardware hack. To summarize, Totality is going to be the newest, most innovative hackathon you could experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of this innovation is possible due to the technology driving Totality. Stay tuned for updates as we open
                     source this technology on our <a href="https://github.com/TotalityHacks">GitHub</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Totality will be hosted at the <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/ofgrWq9iNFv">Brooklyn Expo
                    Center in New York City</a>, a perfect venue for an exciting new hackathon. New York provides an infinite
                    playground for coding breaks, an amazing food scene, and most importantly our venue is easily accessible
                    to the entire northeast by charter bus and/or train while also having three nearby airports for those flying in.

                        <h3>Mentorship</h3>
                        <p>
                            As a result of our focus on experienced hackers, we're making mentorship about having a person to help you work through a bug or discuss an idea. We view mentors as floating teammates&mdash;they won't be there to teach you how to code, but they'll be there when you need a second opinion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We'll be recruiting mentors from throughout the New York area as well as from sponsoring companies. If you're interested in helping mentor, please email <a href="mailto:mentor@totalityhacks.com">mentor@totalityhacks.com</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As with mentors, we're taking advantage of the experienced demographic we're catering for. Workshops will be plentiful, but all on more advanced topics. We won't teach you how to write a for loop, but we're happy to teach you the difference between a RNN and CNN. If you have any specific workshops you'd be interested in, feel free to email <a href="mailto:workshops@totalityhacks.com">workshops@totalityhacks.com</a> and we'll do our best to accommodate. At the end of the day, Totality is your hackathon to learn.

                <h3>The Application Process</h3>
		      <p>
                We encourage everyone to apply to Totality. With that in mind, we do take a bit of a different approach to hackathon admissions. We're mostly looking for people
                who love to make things, but have also proven they are good at it. That doesn't mean you have won hackathons to be at Totality, but more that you can materialize the cool ideas that you think of. Therefore, we want to see all relevant experience from personal projects to jobs to research.

                We're developing a custom system to review applications called <a href="https://github.com/TotalityHacks/madras">madras</a>,
                which we've open sourced. If you want to see exactly how we rate your application, feel free
                to peruse the code.

            </p>
            <h3>Timeline</h3>
		      <p>
                    Applications will open July 16 and close August 10. Decisions will be released by August 31.

                    We don't want financial cost to be a barrier in attending Totality. If you're skilled, we want you. As such, we'll do our best in providing travel reimbursements. Along with your decision, you'll also receive a travel reimbursement cap.
